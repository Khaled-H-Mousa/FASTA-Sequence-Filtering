# FASTA Sequence Filtering

This Python script parses a FASTA file, stores the sequences in a dictionary, and filters them based on their length. It outputs sequences longer than a specified threshold in FASTA format.

## Features
- Parses sequences from a FASTA file.
- Filters sequences with lengths greater than 80 amino acids (default threshold).
- Outputs the filtered sequences in standard FASTA format.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A properly formatted FASTA file as input.
